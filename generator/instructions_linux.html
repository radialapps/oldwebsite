			<li>If you cannot run the file, right click it and click properties. Check Allow executing file. Repeat this step for the files engine-x86 and engine-amd64</li>
			Alternatively, you may go to the directory in terminal and run the following command:
			<blockquote><span style="background-color: #e0e0e0;">
